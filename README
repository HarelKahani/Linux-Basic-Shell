Program description:
The following program is building a basic shell.
the program will get a command from the user by using getLine and insert the command into buffer. 
By using get command function the program split the command that came from the user
and insert the command to the first place, after arguments and finally null.
The program would create a process by using fork, and in the process send the array of the command to execvp.
I did main function, that all the rest of the function happens in it - commandLoop.
in commandLoop all the logic of the program is happening, calling to the different functions.
the program would end by typing 'done'.
after 'done' is typed, the program would show:
1. how many commands typed (include 'done')
2. total size of the all commands which typed
3. the average size of the commands

methods :

ex1 :
void commandLoop();
void getPath();
char* commandLine();
char** splitCommand(char* command);
void exec_launch(char** args);
void printSummary(double aver);
void free_memory(char** args,char* command, char* temp_cmd);
int main()
